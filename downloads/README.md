# Distribution Artifacts

- `aimentor-elementor-v*.zip` — WordPress plugin package containing the AiMentor-branded folder structure (`aimentor-elementor/aimentor-elementor.php`, assets, and includes).

> **Note:** Tagged releases trigger `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds this ZIP and uploads it to the GitHub release automatically. For manual hotfixes, attach the archive to a draft release so the workflow can republish it once the release is published.
