# Distribution Artifacts

- `aimentor-elementor-v*.zip` — WordPress plugin package containing the AiMentor-branded folder structure (`aimentor-elementor/aimentor-elementor.php`, assets, and includes).

> **Note:** Tagged releases trigger `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds this ZIP and uploads it to the GitHub release automatically. These archives are published as release assets rather than tracked in Git history, so download them directly from GitHub Releases. For manual hotfixes, attach the archive to a draft release so the workflow can republish it once the release is published.
