# AiMentor Elementor v1.3.15

## Highlights
- Tracks cumulative success and failure counts for every provider test so administrators can spot reliability regressions.
- Surfaces total tests and localized success rates in the settings panel alongside contextual descriptions.
- Adds lightweight sparkline charts that visualize the most recent provider test history directly beside each badge.

## Upgrade notes
No additional steps are required. Existing provider test history is preserved and the new counters populate automatically the next time a connection check runs.
