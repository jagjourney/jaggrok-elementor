# AiMentor Elementor v1.8.1

## Highlights
- Introduced a Quick Actions management section on the Brand settings tab so administrators can toggle available actions and adjust their default prompts and system instructions without editing code.
- Updated the admin settings JavaScript to render the new controls, sync changes in real time, and persist updates through the REST API with user-facing validation feedback.

## Upgrade Notes
- After updating, visit **Settings → AiMentor → Brand** to confirm the enabled quick actions and tailor any prompt or system guidance for your editors.
