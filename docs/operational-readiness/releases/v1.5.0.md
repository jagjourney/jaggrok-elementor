# AiMentor Elementor v1.5.0

## Highlights
- Introduced the Frame Library workflow so administrators can promote archived AI Layouts, manage preview assets, and curate frame copy.
- Added a dedicated Frame Library panel inside the Elementor widget with one-click insertion and prompt seeding backed by enriched AJAX payloads.
- Expanded REST endpoints and preset catalogs to expose frame metadata for reuse across the editor experience.

## Upgrade notes
- Review the new Frame Library tab under **Settings → Frame Library** to approve layouts and upload thumbnails before editors access them inside Elementor.
- Confirm any automation or documentation that references the update manifest now points to version `1.5.0`.
