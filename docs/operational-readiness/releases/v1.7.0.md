# AiMentor Elementor v1.7.0

## Highlights
- Added a Knowledge Base settings tab with CRUD controls, REST endpoints, and compiled summaries so teams can store reusable packs of product, brand, or process guidance.
- Updated the Elementor generator modal and rewrite workflow to fetch knowledge packs, present a multi-select with live summaries, and send the chosen IDs with every AJAX or REST request.
- Expanded Grok, OpenAI, and Anthropic providers to merge knowledge directives into their prompt suffixes so grounded context flows through every generation and rewrite.

## Developer Notes
- New `aimentor_provider_knowledge_context` filter allows third parties to adjust the provider-ready knowledge payload (including summaries, directives, and IDs) before requests are dispatched.
- `aimentor_compiled_knowledge_payload` continues to filter the raw compiled packs and now includes the sanitized ID list for downstream consumers.
