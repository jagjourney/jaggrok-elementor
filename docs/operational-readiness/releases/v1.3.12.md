# AiMentor Elementor v1.3.12

## Highlights
- Repointed the plugin Update URI, manifest metadata, and landing documentation to the `jagjourney/aimentor-elementor` repository so WordPress update checks fetch the active release.
- Updated the bundled updater defaults to read from the new GitHub Pages manifest endpoint.

## Upgrade Notes
No manual steps are required. Sites configured for automatic updates will download the corrected ZIP on their next check-in once the release is published.
