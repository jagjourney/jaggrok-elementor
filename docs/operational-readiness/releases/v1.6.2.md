# AiMentor Elementor v1.6.2

## Overview
Editors can now rewrite on-page copy without leaving Elementor. The new tone-aware workflow respects stored brand voice keywords, lets writers preview preset tones, and posts rewrites straight back to the active control.

## Highlights
- Added an authenticated AJAX endpoint that validates permissions, builds rewrite prompts, and routes requests through the configured AI provider with rewrite intent metadata.
- Embedded tone preset selectors, rewrite status messaging, and a dedicated **Rewrite with Tone** button inside the Elementor modal.
- Localized supporting strings, refreshed documentation, and expanded automated coverage to verify tone sanitization and rewrite prompt generation.

## Upgrade Notes
No database upgrades are required. Confirm Elementor editors select a tone preset (or rely on saved brand keywords) before triggering rewrites to ensure the desired voice is applied.
