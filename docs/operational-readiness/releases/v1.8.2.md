# AiMentor Elementor v1.8.2

## Highlights
- Extended the shared AJAX payload to expose enabled quick-action metadata, prompt and system defaults, and lookup helpers for the Elementor modal and settings UI.
- Added localized quick-action toolbar labels plus running-state and missing-content messaging to support the refreshed editor experience.
- Ensured both admin settings and Elementor editor scripts receive the enriched payload when enqueued.

## Upgrade Notes
- After updating, refresh the Elementor editor so the modal loads the latest quick-action toolbar text and metadata.
