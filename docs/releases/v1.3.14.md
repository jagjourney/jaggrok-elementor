# AiMentor Elementor v1.3.14

## Highlights
- Added per-provider timeout and temperature override settings so advanced teams can tune request behavior without custom code.
- Introduced an "Advanced" accordion on the settings screen that surfaces the new numeric controls in a compact layout.
- Applied saved override values within the Grok and OpenAI provider payloads so outbound requests honor customized tuning.
- Updated metadata, manifests, and documentation to reference the `jagjourney/aimentor-elementor` release assets now hosting official builds.

## Upgrade notes
No additional action is required after updating. WordPress sites will automatically receive future releases from the Jag Journey–hosted repository thanks to the refreshed metadata and manifest links.
