# AiMentor Elementor v1.0.10 Draft Release Notes

## Summary
- Realigns the plugin header, version constant, and update manifest back to `v1.0.10` so WordPress sees the correct release metadata.
- Syncs documentation, download links, and landing copy with the published `v1.0.10` asset after the premature `v1.1.00` bump.

## Testing
- php -l aimentor-elementor.php
- Automates daily provider health checks with WP-Cron so stored API credentials are re-validated without manual interaction.
- Tracks consecutive connection failures per provider, resetting on success and surfacing alerts when the error threshold is reached.
- Adds settings toggles and recipient controls for administrators to manage scheduled checks and notification routing directly in WordPress.

## Testing
- php -l aimentor-elementor.php
- php -l includes/settings.php
- php -l includes/settings-template.php

## Release Checklist
- [ ] Tag the commit as `v1.0.10` once merged to `main`.
- [ ] Draft the GitHub release using the summary above and attach the generated `aimentor-elementor.zip` asset (built by CI).
- [ ] Publish the release to trigger `.github/workflows/release.yml` and verify the manifest update on `gh-pages`.
