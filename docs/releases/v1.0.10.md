# AiMentor Elementor v1.0.10 Draft Release Notes

## Summary
- Realigns the plugin header, version constant, and update manifest back to `v1.0.10` so WordPress sees the correct release metadata.
- Syncs documentation, download links, and landing copy with the published `v1.0.10` asset after the premature `v1.1.00` bump.

## Testing
- php -l aimentor-elementor.php

## Release Checklist
- [ ] Tag the commit as `v1.0.10` once merged to `main`.
- [ ] Draft the GitHub release using the summary above and attach the generated `aimentor-elementor-v1.0.10.zip` asset (built by CI).
- [ ] Publish the release to trigger `.github/workflows/release.yml` and verify the manifest update on `gh-pages`.
