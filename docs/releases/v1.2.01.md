# AiMentor Elementor v1.2.01 Draft Release Notes

## Summary
- Keep the GitHub-backed updater bootstrap active even when Elementor is inactive so WordPress always detects available releases.

## Release checklist
- [ ] Refresh plugin metadata, manifest references, and landing collateral to publish the 1.2.01 maintenance release.
- [ ] Smoke test automatic update prompts on a reference WordPress environment running Elementor and core-only configurations.
- [ ] Tag the commit as `v1.2.01` once merged to `main`.
- [ ] Draft the GitHub release using the summary above and attach the generated `aimentor-elementor-v1.2.01.zip` asset (built by CI).
