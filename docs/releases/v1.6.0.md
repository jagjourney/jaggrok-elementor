# AiMentor Elementor v1.6.0

## Highlights
- Request and review multiple Elementor canvas variations from every provider in a single run.
- Insert the chosen variation after previewing metadata, then sync the selection back to the canvas history and cooldown notices.
- Documented the multi-style workflow with new localization strings and screenshots for editors.

## Upgrade Notes
- No database migrations are required. Clear any local caches to ensure the new JavaScript renders the variation cards.
