# AiMentor Elementor v1.8.0

## Highlights
- **Automation jobs** – New settings tab lets administrators define recurring generation jobs, select post filters, cadence, prompt sources, and knowledge packs for each run.
- **Cron-powered runner** – A dedicated automation engine schedules jobs, reuses the existing generation pipeline, tracks rate limits, and saves outputs as AI Layout drafts linked to their source content.
- **Review queue** – Logs tab now surfaces automation queues and pending drafts with approve/apply or dismiss actions so editors can control when generated layouts go live.
- **Documentation & safeguards** – Added guidance covering recommended cadences, rate-limit protections, and review workflows to keep automation safe for production sites.

## Upgrade Notes
1. Visit **Settings → AiMentor → Automation** to enable the hourly scheduler and configure jobs for your most important content types.
2. Ensure WordPress cron is running (or configure a server cron) so the automation runner executes on schedule.
3. Review the Automation section of the logs tab after the first run to approve or dismiss generated drafts before publishing.
