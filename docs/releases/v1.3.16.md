# AiMentor Elementor v1.3.16

## Highlights
- Adds a support and learning resources sidebar to the settings page so teams can quickly reach JagJourney guidance and contact options.
- Centralizes sidebar links in a filterable helper, letting developers customize resources without editing the template directly.

## Upgrade notes
No manual steps are required. The sidebar appears automatically and developers can hook `aimentor_settings_support_resources` to adjust the presented links.
