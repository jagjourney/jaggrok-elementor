# AiMentor Elementor v1.6.1

## Overview
This release streamlines the Elementor editing experience by moving the layout history and curated frame browsing tools into the AiMentor modal. Editors now work from a single dialog while the canvas stays clear for live layout previews.

## Highlights
- Simplified the widget placeholder so the Elementor canvas stays open for generated content, with a single launch button to reopen the modal.
- Added a modal sidebar that surfaces recent layout history and the curated frame library with Elementor-aligned styling.
- Updated modal bindings to handle the new sidebar tabs, ensuring history entries and frames refresh without relying on canvas markup.

## Upgrade Notes
No database changes are required. Open the AiMentor modal after updating to access the relocated history and frame panels.
