== Description ==
🚀 FREE AI Page Builder - Generate full Elementor layouts with AiMentor. One prompt = complete pages!

* ⚡ Rapid section, page, and template generation inside Elementor.
* 🔁 Multi-provider switching with provider-specific defaults and limits.
* 🔒 Secure key handling, visibility toggles, and connection health badges.
* 📊 Error logging and rate-limit visibility for confident production use.

AiMentor was built for agencies that need reliable AI output without leaving WordPress. Bring your preferred provider, align the models with your workflow, and let AiMentor keep the content flowing.

== Features ==
* **Provider model presets:** Ship with tuned defaults for Grok and OpenAI so each provider loads with recommended models, temperature, and safety guardrails tailored to their API capabilities.
* **Multi-style canvas cards:** Review multiple layout variations per run, insert the favorite option, and log the chosen design in the canvas history automatically.
* **Knowledge packs & grounded context:** Capture reusable brand, product, or process notes in the Knowledge Base tab and apply them to every Elementor generation or rewrite.
* **Auto-Insert toggle:** Decide if generated layouts land directly in the Elementor canvas or wait for manual placement—perfect for teams that want review checkpoints.
* **Theme styling controls:** Keep generated sections on-brand by toggling AiMentor's theme-aware styling helpers on or off per site.
* **Token limit management:** Configure per-provider token ceilings to prevent runaway prompts and stay inside your contract limits.
* **API key visibility controls:** Reveal or mask keys instantly with the built-in eye toggle so only trusted teammates can view sensitive credentials.
* **Connection status badges:** Test each provider and get immediate success, pending, or error badges that confirm when an integration is ready for production.
* **Built-in error log viewer:** Inspect the most recent API issues without leaving WordPress; the underlying log file lives at `wp-content/uploads/aimentor/aimentor-errors.log` (with automatic fallbacks if that path is unavailable).
* **Tone-aware rewrites:** Highlight Elementor copy and apply the “Rewrite with Tone” action to instantly align language with the saved brand keywords or preset voices.

== Frame Workflow ==
1. **Generate** layouts inside Elementor using AiMentor canvas requests. Each run can be archived with its provider, model, and prompt metadata for later reuse.
2. **Archive** winning layouts so they appear under the private `AI Layouts` post type. Archival keeps historical prompts alongside the JSON canvas payload.
3. **Promote to frame** from **Settings → Frame Library**. Administrators can toggle curated layouts, upload fresh preview thumbnails, refine summaries, and confirm suggested sections that editors will see.
4. **Reuse** frames in Elementor. The AiMentor widget now surfaces a Frame Library panel that lists approved layouts with one-click insertion or prompt seeding to jumpstart new generations.

Tip: periodically retire stale frames or swap preview imagery to keep the gallery current. A small rotation—removing unused layouts and promoting fresh winners—keeps the experience fast for editors.

== Compatibility ==
AiMentor requires the free version of Elementor to be active for its widget, settings, and copy workflows to load. When Elementor Pro is detected, advanced experiences—including canvas JSON generation and the in-dashboard **Pro Features** toggle—automatically light up. If Elementor Pro is not available, AiMentor gracefully downgrades canvas requests to copy output while keeping all text generation flows first-class for free users, so teams can still ship content without compromise.

=== Roadmap / Suggestions ===
We're exploring deeper Pro-aware enhancements such as exporting full template kits, supporting Elementor Theme Builder sections, and broader automation hooks so Pro customers can unlock richer handoff options while the free tier keeps its streamlined experience.

== Elementor Widget Experience ==
AiMentor's widget mirrors the native Elementor workflow: pick your provider from the branded badge selector, drop a prompt into the focused input field, and trigger generation without losing context. Provider-colored badges keep the active model obvious, while the same connection health indicators used in the settings surface directly in the widget so editors know when it's safe to launch a run.

Need to adjust existing copy? Select any text within the Elementor editor or reuse the prompt field, choose a tone preset in the AiMentor modal, and click **Rewrite with Tone**. The widget posts your selection to WordPress, rewrites it through the active AI provider, and swaps the response directly into the targeted control while logging the tone that was applied. Status messaging in the modal confirms when the rewrite completes or if additional input is required.

== Operational Tooling ==
* **Error log access:** Every request writes structured context to `wp-content/uploads/aimentor/aimentor-errors.log`, and the settings screen renders the last 10 entries with timestamps and provider names for fast triage.

== WP-CLI ==
Run AiMentor generations from the command line once the plugin is active and the provider API keys are configured.

* **Prerequisites:** Install [WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org/) on the WordPress host, ensure the AiMentor plugin is active, and store the necessary provider API key in the plugin settings.
* **Generate content:** `wp aimentor generate --prompt="Homepage hero for a bakery" --provider=grok`
* **Generate canvas JSON to a file:** `wp aimentor generate --prompt="Landing page wireframe" --task=canvas --out=canvas.json`
* **Override defaults:** Use `--tier`, `--max_tokens`, or `--provider` to align the run with stored presets without altering the saved configuration.
* **Connection health badges:** The settings dashboard keeps a persistent badge per provider—Success, Pending, Error, or Idle—so agencies can verify API uptime before teams start building.

== Installation ==
1. Upload ZIP.
2. Bring API credentials for your preferred provider—generate an xAI Grok key at https://x.ai/api or create an OpenAI key at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.
3. Open **Settings → AiMentor Elementor** and choose **xAI Grok** or **OpenAI** under **Provider** to set the active radio option.
4. Paste your keys and click the **Test Connection** buttons to verify each provider so you know when their API keys are valid.

== Automatic Updates ==
AiMentor Elementor now advertises GitHub Releases as its canonical update source. The plugin bootstrap includes an `Update URI`
that matches this repository, so WordPress core surfaces each published release in the **Plugins** screen.

* Enable **Automatic updates** for AiMentor Elementor in **Plugins → Installed Plugins** to let WordPress install new GitHub
  releases as soon as they are published.
* Prefer manual control? When a new AiMentor Elementor version appears, click **Update now** in the plugin list to fetch the
  GitHub-hosted ZIP without leaving the dashboard.

No additional AiMentor-specific updater endpoints are required—the historical PHP/JSON feed has been retired in favor of the
native GitHub channel.

== Development ==
* Source code: https://github.com/jagjourney/aimentor-elementor
* Latest ZIP (tagged releases): https://github.com/jagjourney/aimentor-elementor/releases
* Release automation: `.github/workflows/release.yml` validates PHP syntax, builds the ZIP package, attaches it to the release,
  and refreshes the lightweight manifest on `gh-pages`.
* Release checklist and versioning guide: `docs/release-guide.md`.

== Hooks ==
* `aimentor_compiled_knowledge_payload` — Filter the raw compiled knowledge packs before they are cached for provider consumption.
* `aimentor_provider_knowledge_context` — Filter the provider-ready knowledge payload (including summaries, guidance, and IDs) before each request is dispatched.

== Deployment ==
Tagged releases automatically produce `aimentor-elementor-v<version>.zip` via GitHub Actions and attach the artifact to the corresponding release. A JSON manifest maintained on the `gh-pages` branch mirrors the latest tag for any external tooling that still references it.
Refer to `docs/release-guide.md` for detailed tagging, workflow, and post-release steps.

Need to stage a build before publication? Save the GitHub release as a draft—the automation now packages and uploads the official ZIP while deferring the manifest update until you publish. Manual ZIP uploads remain optional for bespoke artifacts.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Does AiMentor support multiple AI providers? =
Yes. The control center lets you pick between xAI Grok and OpenAI today, with room to add additional providers as new APIs are released. Each provider keeps its own defaults and usage limits.

= Where are my API keys stored? =
Keys are saved in your WordPress database using the standard options table. You can hide or show keys on demand from the settings screen, and revoke them at any time from your AI provider dashboard.

= Can I disable automatic insertion into the canvas? =
Absolutely. Use the **Auto-Insert** toggle in the settings to decide if generated content drops straight into Elementor or if you prefer manual placement.

== Screenshots ==
1. Drag AiMentor widget to canvas
2. Enter prompt in left panel
